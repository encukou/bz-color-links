Custom CSS for Firefox to color links in bugzilla.redhat.com queries according to status.

## Installation

- Open the Profile Directory found in Firefox [Troubleshooting info](about:support)
- Save the file as `chrome/userContent.css` (or append to an existing file).
  (BTW, the term [`chrome`](https://ell.stackexchange.com/a/96746/87733)
  is older than the competing browser...)
- Restart Firefox

More info on `userContent.css` is
[at mozillaZine](http://kb.mozillazine.org/UserContent.css).
